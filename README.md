To keep griefers away from the server all new players don't get interact privs.
They have to go through this entrance exam to get the necessary privs.

Goal of the exam is to build an altar with an offering bowl.
After offering the defined items (see settings.lua) the player has passed the exam.
He wil be teleported to the starting position and the exam scope is deleted for the next exam.
